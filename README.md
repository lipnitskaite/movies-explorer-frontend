# Movies Explorer

## Project's description  

A project for the Yandex Practicum Web development course where I created an interactive SPA for searching and saving movies.<br>

On the main page, there's my short portfolio and info about what I've learnt during the course. To explore movies, users need to be registered and authorized. After the authorization users are redirected to the movies page, where they can search for and save movies. Also, after authorization users can change their profile info. The landing is adapted for screens of 320, 768, and 1280px width.<br>

This is a full-stack project, so I had an opportunity to practice both front and back. One of the main challenges for me was figuring out how to implement a working search filter using API data. Apart from that, it was interesting and fun to learn how to dynamically save and delete movies from favourites.<br>

This project allowed me to dive deeper into React using states, hooks, and React's libraries, such as 'react-router' or 'react-email-validator'. I've also practiced JSX, CSS, and VanillaJS. The back part is created using node.js, REST API, and MongoDB.<br>
